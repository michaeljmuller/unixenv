I have to have my dot files in github, or I'm not cool, or so my office mate tells me.

My repo needs a README, or github yells at me.

My README needs to be in markup format, or gruber will revoke my Apple fanboy license.

Hopefully, I've now satisfied all the basic requirements and can now remain gainfully employed in the tech sector.
